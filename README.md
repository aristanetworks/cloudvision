# CloudVision

CloudVision is a network management framework supporting workload orchestration, workflow
automation and telemetry.

## CloudVision Database

The CloudVision Database is a large-scale distributed database for generic, semi-structured
state sharing and archival. The database is a core component of CloudVision but may also be
used as a platform to write versatile client applications. The CloudVision Database exposes
a [data model](docs/data_model.md) which may be used in conjunction with a
[REST API](docs/apiserver_rest.md) and [WebSocket API](docs/cloudvision-connector.md) to
interact with the system.

> Note: The CloudVision Database is undergoing rapid development and the APIs are subject
to change.
